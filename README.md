Notebook for the anomalib library to start easily with your own dataset. The notebook infer_example_with_train.ipynb will train the model inside the notebook itself, the notebook infer_example.ipynb will load an already trained model.
The [anomalib library](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib) is a library for unsupervised anomaly detection.
